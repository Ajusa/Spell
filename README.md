Tis a game, inspired by Magicka. That doesn't really do it justice. It is a MMO magic game, with some elements from RPG's. Currently, the game is in HEAVY development.

#A Brief History of the Game (Written by Ajusa)
The idea for Spell came from an old google doc (2012) that a friend and I had made. We wrote game ideas, and it was forgotten. Until 2015, when work on Spell started. Spell's codebase was from another game that a friend and I had developed, but we both had abandoned the project, called ZDefense2. In a way, Spell is based upon ZDefense and ZDefense2, because the collsion code and the player code is very similar. Today, the game is getting closer and closer to completion. Multiplayer works (technically), spells work (also technically, they are invis and kill you), and things like mana regen also work. To see what needs to be done, or to add an idea, go over to the "Issues" tab.
